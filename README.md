# Compression-Algorithm

Compression Algorithm Implemented: Huffman Coding

We will implement an algorithm that would compress any given text.
We will then print the frequency of each alphabet in the text along with its location in the tree. (Encode the text)
We will then compare the decoded text with its binary file which would give us the compression ratio of the text.
